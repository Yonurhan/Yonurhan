## 👋 Hi, I'm Yonathan Nurhan!

🎓 Final-year **Computer Science & Mathematics** student at **BINUS University**  
🧠 Strong in **Machine Learning, Data Analysis, and Software Developing**  
📍 Jakarta, Indonesia  

I love transforming raw data into meaningful insights using a combination of  
**mathematics, statistics, domain understanding, and machine learning models**.  
I enjoy working with real datasets — especially in **health, behavior, and image data** — and turning them into actionable results.
